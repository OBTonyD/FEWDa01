#San Diego: more than just beaches

I'm not surprised when people from out of town think of great weather and beaches when they think of San Diego. But way too many San Diegans don't seem to know how blessed we are in terms of all of our rich topography, with the desert, mountains, forests and spectacular waterfalls easily within reach. Many don't know, for example, that San Diego County has more bird species than any other.

###Go check out the wildflowers

One of my favorite things to do this time of year is check out the amazing wildflowers that only bloom for only short periods in the winter months. Many flock to Borrego Springs in the Anza Borrego state park, which offers guided hikes and even an excellent, free, long-term class on the subject. However, I prefer Joshua Tree National Park, especially the southern area near Cottonwood Springs along the trail to Lost Palms Oasis. I've seen spectacular displays of such species as:
* mojave aster
* yellow blazingstar
* desert mallow
* sacred datura
* desert marigolds

A series of good rains soaked the desert floor and produced this marvelous carpet of desert daisies in 1973.

There's so much more to see and do in Joshua Tree, the national park closest to San Diego. Find out more at the [Joshua Tree official website](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm).
